# はじめに
I bought a Nintendo Switch, which I hadn't bought before, because I heard that the new Pokémon was going to be released. However, there was a problem that one Joy-Con could be used in portable mode, but not in TV mode or table mode.

I didn't see the same phenomenon on the official support page, but similar problems have been found in the wisdom bags.

I could have sent it back to Nintendo to have it repaired because it was defective in the beginning, but I took it apart and repaired it.

# Symptoms
- When the Joy-Con is connected to the main body, you will hear a pleasant sound "clink" from the main body.
- They don't charge you.
- Only when connected to the main unit is the operation effective.

# Procedure
I tried to restart the main unit and press and hold the sync button of the Joy-Con, but there was no change in the symptoms.

Since it's recognized as a Joy-Con, it's not a problem with the base of the Joy-Con itself, but rather the charging and battery...
I used a Y-shaped screwdriver to remove the screw on the back side and looked inside.

When I pushed lightly with the driver, it felt like it was stuck with a click.
Hmm? Could this be the cause?
Putting the case back on and putting it back on the main body...

He recognized it. (It's brand new, so it's fully charged.)

I was able to use it in TV mode and table mode without any problem.
It's all good and happy.

The connector in question this time was a connector that snaps on from the top.
It was hard to take it off once it was attached, so I thought that it was not properly attached at the manufacturing stage.

I'm curious whether it's a human or a machine that's setting it up.
